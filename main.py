This should serve as the entry point for a pair of python chat bots.
One will connect to Twitch and the other to Discord.

Both scripts should share a common CSV file full of Chat Commands and responses.
Boths scripts should be able to Read, Update, Add, and Delete from the CSV file.
Any chat command updated in the CSV should immediately be available to both
chat bots.
